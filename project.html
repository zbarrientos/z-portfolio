        <h3> Summary </h3>
        <p> Warrior is a cloud storage and data visualization app for the athlete that wants to truly understand where their training, nutrition, and other fitness habits are taking them. Warrior’s unique data entry, visualization, and compatibility features help users consolidate all their data in one place while giving them greater control in the way they organize, view, analyze and share their data.</p>

          <h3> Research </h3>
          <h4> 1.1 User Surveys </h4>
          <p>At this early stage, it was critical to get insights from a variety of users who participate in different sports and who have differing fitness goals in order to uncover the target audience’s core needs and pain points. In particular, additional information was needed for:</p>
            <li>User's data tracking methods</li>
            <li>Likes/dislikes for current tracking methods</li>
            <li>User file sharing habits</li>
            <li>Data visualization needs</li>
            <span class="spacer"> </span>
          <p>To get insights on these questions, a survey was created and distributed online using social media and survey forums. The survey received 47 responses, primarily from athletes based in the United States, Europe and Latin America. The survey was distributed via e-mail, social media and athlete forums.</p>
        </section>

        <section class= "casestudy_section">
          <p>Some significant insights obtained from the surveys included:</p>
            <li>98% of today’s athletes track wellness data</li>
            <li>99% of respondents wanted compatibility with specific fitness apps</li>
            <li>80% of users rated data visualization as a priority</li>
            <li>Nearly 50% of users exclusively use mobile fitness apps to track data</li>
            <li>37.5% use a combination (Fitness app, cloud, manual)</li>
            <li>12.5% manually track data</li>
            <span class="spacer"> </span>
          <p>It was clear from these results that an overwhelming amount of everyday athletes track wellness data, that they want this data to be accessible on their phone, and that they want a solution that is highly compatible with other fitness apps and that includes graphing/visualization features.</p>

          <h4> 1.2 Competitive Analysis </h4>
            <p>With so many cloud storage and fitness apps in the market, an analysis of the competition was needed to obtain an understanding of where the competitors were succeeding and where they were falling short in order to design a solution that filled the existing gaps. To accomplish this, a competitive analysis was conducted that included user flows of the fundamental features of the products.</p>

            <p> When surveyed, users revealed that the top cloud storage and fitness apps they used to store wellness data were Google Drive, DropBox, and FitBot.</p>

            <li>User's data tracking methods</li>
            <li>Likes/dislikes for current tracking methods</li>

            <li>Data visualization needs</li>
