        <h3> Summary </h3>
        <p> The main challenge for this project was to help the AAEC develop an elegant brand that would appeal to, and help recruit, high-level legal professionals across the Americas. It was also important that the brand reflect the culture and heritage of the region because the AAEC is the only association of its kind in the region, making it the international face of the Central American in-house profession. </p>

          <h3> Visual Identity </h3>
          <p> To reflect the region’s heritage, the brand was constructed around two visual themes: the iconic chunky figures and caricatures found on Mayan temples and traditional Mesoamerican textile designs. </p>
          <p> After rounds of iterations, the association ultimately chose a design that utilized their logo in a discreet textile-like pattern as the main visual element for their brand. I decided to use the logo in this way because it is very clean and geometric but still reminiscent of the shapes found in Central American embroidery.  By creating a pseudo-textile with the logo, I was able to incorporate local culture while still preserving an overall clean and modern feel, making it appropriate for the legal industry and my client's aesthetic. </p>

          <p> Color Palette </p>
          <p> The color palette used was composed of warm taupes and deep browns to reflect the region’s indigenous past and connection with the earth. These colors were paired with black and white to accomplish an overall clean and modern look. </p>
          <p> Typography </p>
          <p> The typography used was Josefin Sans Bold for the headers and and Open Sans for the body copy. These fonts were selected due to their architectural and bold qualities, mimicking the evenness of the lines found in the logo as well as in Maya script. </p>

            <h3> Messaging </h3>
              <p> To create a unique brand identity for the association the messaging was centered around the socially conscious and ethical objectives that drove the creation of the association, as opposed to simply characterizing it as a networking group like many similar organizations have done.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="casestudy_section">
            <h3> Conclusion </h3>
            <p> As a designer, it was very rewarding to be a part of the messaging and content creation process for this project because it lead to a deep understanding of the identity of the organization from a conceptual level, as well as a knowledge of the individuals behind the organization. Before setting pen to paper, this understanding gave me enhanced focus in my designs because I understood not only the strategic objectives and audience, but also the aesthetic preferences of my clients and the historical nuances that gave a unique personality to the organization. </p>

            <p> Initially, I thought that my client's strict minimalistic aesthetic might be incompatible with the general aesthetic of the region (i.e. vibrant colors and intricate patterns). However, as the process evolved, I realized that these constraints actually acted as catalysts for creativity. The tension between modern and ancient lead me down a path I might not have explored and resulted in unexpected and elegant solutions. </p>
